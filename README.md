# For the use of this app you will need to clone/download the next two repositorys.

1. For the app this one [Reactapp](https://github.com/Drakang/Practica-React-KC)
2. For the backend this one [Nodepop-api](https://github.com/davidjj76/nodepop-api)


## How it works:

    Run with NPM I to install dependencies and then run the api with NPM START, that gonna run on your localhost:3001 and you can take access to a swagger, will need to create a user to start with the app.


    Run the app with NPM I to install dependencies and run the app with NPM START, that gonna run on your localhost:3000 and can take acces to the login page


### Login with the email and password you should put on the swagger before( if mark the checkbox you will still loged though you close the app)

     If you do correctly you should have access to the adverts page, in this view you can see all the adverts, but if its your first time, should gonna make some


     If you wanna filter the adverts you can select it by:
      -Name
      -Type
      -Sell Status
      -Price Min-Max
      -Tags




     Also you can see the details of the adverts clicking on the advert in the main page.




     You can delete the advert on this detail page(that launch a confirmation message if you dont want to delete it ðŸ˜‰ðŸ˜‰ðŸ˜‰ðŸ˜‰)



     To get out the adverts page and return to the login you can logout clicking on the Logout button on the right-top of the page(Another confirmation message will appear ðŸ˜‰ðŸ˜‰ðŸ˜‰ðŸ˜‰)

# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
